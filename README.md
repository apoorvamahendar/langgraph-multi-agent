# ðŸ§  LangGraph Multi-Agent AI â€“ Math Solver & Verifier

This project demonstrates a simple **Agentic AI workflow** using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), where multiple agents collaborate to solve and verify a math problem.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Solver Agent**: Receives a math expression (e.g. `"12 * (5 + 3)"`) and evaluates it.
- **Verifier Agent**: Validates the solution by re-evaluating the original question.
- **LangGraph**: Connects these agents in a defined flow using a state graph.
